# Hydration Tracker

This app is used to track water consumed per day. This app helps remind us about our goals to drink water in a day. We can set our own goals and see histories by date
## Tech Stack

* **100% Kotlin**, using coroutines for background thread
* **Splash Screen** API
* **Jetpack Compose** for UI Components
* **Work Manager** for automation task scheduler
* **Room** Database
* **Dagger hilt** for dependency injection
* **Navigation components**

## Folder Structures
The structure module used follows the guidelines of a clean architecture by dividing it into several folders with the following details
- data : Used to handle all of the transactions in the application (mainly used to handle database transaction)
- di : DI stands for Dependency Injection, use to inject class that we will need to use in our application
- navigation : Used to define navigations in the application
- theme : Used to define UI properties (color, font, shape, and theme)
- ui : Handle user interface (divided into components and screens), every screens has subfolder and every subfolder contains at least viewmodel, state, and screen
- utils : Define helper const and functions
- worker : Place for Work Manager
